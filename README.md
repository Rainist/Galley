# Galley

A kitchen to cook k8s objects

## Why?
Cause some times you want some recipes ready to cook things faster

## Use it here
https://rainist.github.io/galley

## Road Map
- Currently it has only one recipe cause cooking those env mappings were most painful
- Hoping to have more useful features if it makes sense to have under Galley
